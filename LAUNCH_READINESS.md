## 🐛 Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: Email Features Not Active
**Impact:** Users can't reset passwords via email
**Workaround:** Manually reset passwords in database OR implement email service
**Fix Time:** 30 minutes (add SendGrid)

### Issue 2: No File Uploads Yet
**Impact:** Users can't upload profile pictures or campaign images
**Workaround:** Use placeholder images or default avatars (already in place)
**Fix Time:** 1-2 hours (add multer + cloud storage)

### Issue 3: User Names Not Persisted
**Impact:** Names stored in localStorage only
**Workaround:** Modal prompts for name on login (already implemented)
**Fix Time:** 30 minutes (add name field to database + API endpoint)

**ALL ISSUES ARE NON-CRITICAL FOR MVP LAUNCH**
