## 🎯 WHAT CHANGED

**BEFORE:**
```
npm install → npx prisma generate ❌ → npm run build → npm start
```

**AFTER:**
```
npm install → npm run build ✅ → npm start
```

---

## 🔍 BUILD SHOULD SHOW

✅ Installing dependencies
✅ Compiling TypeScript
✅ Starting Node server
✅ MongoDB connection established

❌ Should NOT see "prisma" anywhere in logs

---

## 📞 IF BUILD FAILS

1. **Clear Railway Cache**
   - Railway Dashboard → Settings → Clear Build Cache

2. **Check MongoDB URI**
   - Verify connection string is correct
   - Check MongoDB Atlas whitelist includes Railway IPs

3. **Check Logs**
   - Railway Dashboard → Logs
   - Look for actual error (not Prisma)

---

## 🎉 READY TO DEPLOY!

All Prisma references removed.
Backend is 100% Mongoose.
Railway configuration is clean.

**Just commit and push!**

```bash
git push origin main
```

Railway will handle the rest.
