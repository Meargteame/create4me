# Navigation Simplification & Login Redirect Updates

## Summary
Successfully simplified the application navigation to show only 3 main pages for logged-in users and configured automatic redirection to the Campaign Feed page after login/registration.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. ‚úÖ Navigation Simplified (Header.tsx)
**Current Navigation Structure:**

**For Logged-In Users:**
- üé® **Find Creators** (`/creators`)
- üì¢ **Campaign Feed** (`/feed`)  
- üåê **Network** (`/network`)

**For Landing Page (Not Logged In):**
- Home
- Features
- Creators
- How It Works
- Stats

**Navigation Code Location:**
- File: `/react-frontend/src/components/Header.tsx`
- Lines: 275-340 (App navigation section)

The navigation already displays only these 3 pages when users are logged in. The conditional rendering checks `isHomePage` to show different navigation items.

### 2. ‚úÖ Login Redirect to Feed Page

#### LoginModal.tsx
- **Added:** `import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'`
- **Added:** `const navigate = useNavigate()` hook
- **Modified:** Success handler now includes `navigate('/feed')`
- **Result:** After successful login via modal, users are redirected to `/feed`

#### LoginPage.tsx  
- **Modified:** Removed role-based dashboard redirect logic
- **Changed:** All successful logins now redirect to `/feed` regardless of role
- **Before:**
  ```typescript
  if (userRole === 'brand') {
    navigate('/brand-dashboard')
  } else {
    navigate('/creator-dashboard')
  }
  ```
- **After:**
  ```typescript
  navigate('/feed')
  ```

### 3. ‚úÖ Registration Redirect to Feed Page

#### RegisterModal.tsx
- **Added:** `import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'`
- **Added:** `const navigate = useNavigate()` hook

- **Result:** After successful registration via modal, users are redirected to `/feed`

#### SignupPage.tsx
- **Modified:** Removed role-based dashboard redirect logic
- **Changed:** All successful registrations now redirect to `/feed` regardless of role
- **Before:**
  ```typescript
  if (formData.role === 'brand') {
    navigate('/brand-dashboard')
  } else {
    navigate('/creator-dashboard')
  }
  ```
- **After:**

  ```

- ‚ùå Dashboard pages (creator-dashboard, brand-dashboard)
