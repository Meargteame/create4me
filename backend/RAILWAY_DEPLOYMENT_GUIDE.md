# ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Guide for Create4Me Backend

## Prerequisites
- Railway account (sign up at https://railway.app)
- GitHub repository (optional but recommended)
- MongoDB database (Railway MongoDB or MongoDB Atlas)

## Step 1: Prepare Your Database

### Option A: MongoDB Atlas (Recommended)
1. Go to https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
2. Create a free cluster
3. Create a database user with password
4. Whitelist all IPs (0.0.0.0/0) for Railway access
5. Get your connection string:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/create4me?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

### Option B: Railway MongoDB
1. In Railway dashboard, click "New" â†’ "Database" â†’ "Add MongoDB"
2. Copy the connection string from the MongoDB service variables

## Step 2: Deploy to Railway

### Method 1: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to Railway dashboard
3. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Railway will auto-detect the configuration

### Method 2: Deploy using Railway CLI
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Link to your project
railway link

# Deploy
railway up
```

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

In Railway dashboard, go to your service â†’ Variables tab and add:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/create4me?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-random-string-here
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-url.netlify.app
```

### Generate a secure JWT_SECRET:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

## Step 4: Configure Build Settings

Railway should auto-detect the settings from `railway.json`, but verify:

**Build Command:**
```bash
npm install && npx prisma generate && npm run build
```

**Start Command:**
```bash
npm start
```

## Step 5: Deploy and Monitor

1. Click "Deploy" in Railway dashboard
2. Monitor the build logs
3. Once deployed, Railway will provide a public URL like:
   ```
   https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
   ```

## Step 6: Test Your Deployment

Test the health endpoint:
```bash
curl https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/health
curl https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/api/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Step 7: Update Frontend Configuration

Update your frontend's `.env` file with the Railway backend URL:
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/api
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly
- Check build logs for specific errors

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify MongoDB connection string format
- Check if IP whitelist includes 0.0.0.0/0 (for Atlas)
- Ensure database user has correct permissions

### CORS Errors
- Add your frontend URL to `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable
- Verify CORS configuration in `server.ts`

### Prisma Issues
- Ensure `npx prisma generate` runs in build command
- Check that `prisma` is in dependencies (not devDependencies)

## Monitoring and Logs

View logs in Railway:
```bash
railway logs
```

Or in the Railway dashboard â†’ Deployments â†’ View Logs

## Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to Settings â†’ Domains in Railway
2. Click "Generate Domain" or "Custom Domain"
3. Follow instructions to configure DNS

## Environment-Specific Notes

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production (Local Test)
```bash
npm run build
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

## Rollback

If deployment fails:
1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Click on a previous successful deployment
3. Click "Redeploy"

## Cost Optimization

Railway offers:
- $5 free credit per month
- Pay-as-you-go pricing
- Sleep mode for inactive services

## Security Checklist

- âœ… Strong JWT_SECRET set
- âœ… DATABASE_URL not exposed in code
- âœ… CORS properly configured
- âœ… Helmet middleware enabled
- âœ… Environment variables set in Railway (not in code)
- âœ… MongoDB IP whitelist configured
- âœ… HTTPS enabled (automatic on Railway)

## Next Steps

1. Set up monitoring (Railway provides basic metrics)
2. Configure custom domain
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline
4. Add logging service (optional)
5. Set up backup strategy for MongoDB
