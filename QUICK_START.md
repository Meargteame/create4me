# Quick Start Guide - Dynamic Data

## ‚úÖ What's Been Done

All pages now fetch and display real-time data from your backend database:

1. **Creators Page** - Shows 4 real creators from database
2. **Feed Page (Campaigns)** - Shows 3 real campaigns  
3. **Network Page** - Shows connections
4. **Brand Dashboard** - Shows brand campaigns
5. **Creator Dashboard** - Shows applications

## üöÄ How to Test

### 1. Make Sure Everything is Running

```bash
# Check backend (should return "pong")
curl http://localhost:3001/api/test

# Check if MongoDB is running
sudo systemctl status mongod

# If backend not running:
cd backend
npm run dev

# If frontend not running:
cd backend/react-frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open the Application

```
http://localhost:5173
```

### 3. Test Each Page

**Creators Page:**
- Go to http://localhost:5173/creators
- Should see 4 creator cards with real data
- Open browser console (F12) to see debug logs

**Feed Page:**
- Go to http://localhost:5173/feed
- Should see campaign cards
- Try filtering and searching

**Network Page:**
- Go to http://localhost:5173/network
- Should see connections

### 4. Check Browser Console

All pages now log detailed information:
- API responses
- Mapped data
- Any errors

## üìä Sample Data in Database

After seeding, you have:
- **7 users** (3 brands, 4 creators)
- **4 creator profiles** (Hanan, Dawit, Meron, Yohannes)
- **3 campaigns** (from brands)
- **Several applications** and connections

## üîë Test Credentials

**Brand Account:**
```
Email: ethiocoffee@example.com
Password: password123
```

**Creator Account:**
```
Email: hanan@example.com
Password: password123
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**No data showing?**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check if backend is running: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/creators`
3. Re-seed database: `cd backend && npm run seed`

**"Authentication required" error?**
- You need to login first
- Some pages require authentication

**Still having issues?**
1. Read `DATA_FETCHING_FIX.md` for detailed explanation
2. Read `DYNAMIC_PAGES_UPDATE.md` for complete changes list
3. Check backend logs: `tail -f /tmp/backend-dev.log`

## ‚ú® What to Look For

When you open the Creators page, you should see:
- ‚úÖ "4 creators available" at the top
- ‚úÖ Green badge: "Data Loaded: 4 creators fetched successfully"
- ‚úÖ 4 creator cards displaying
- ‚úÖ Stats showing (Total: 4, Available: 4, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Console logs showing API response

## üìù Next Steps

Now that all pages are fetching real data:
1. Test all features (search, filter, sort)
2. Test authenticated actions (like, bookmark, apply)
3. Create more test data if needed
4. Remove debug console.log statements before production
5. Add more comprehensive error handling
