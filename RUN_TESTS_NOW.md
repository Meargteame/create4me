# 🚀 Ready to Test - Run These Commands

## Step 1: Restart TypeScript Server (IMPORTANT!)

In VS Code:
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
2. Type: `TypeScript: Restart TS Server`
3. Press Enter
4. Wait a few seconds for restart

This clears the type cache so new Prisma fields are recognized.

## Step 2: Start Backend Server

Open Terminal 1:
```bash
cd /home/meareg/Desktop/create4me/backend
npm run dev
```

✅ You should see:
```
Server running on port 3001
```

---

## Step 3: Start Frontend Server

Open Terminal 2:
```bash
cd /home/meareg/Desktop/create4me/react-frontend
npm run dev
```

✅ You should see:
```
Local: http://localhost:5173
```

---

## Step 4: Open Browser & Test

1. **Navigate to**: http://localhost:5173

2. **Register as Creator**:
   - Click "Register"
   - Email: `creator@test.com`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Role: Select "Creator" (if available)
   - Click Register

3. **Auto-navigate to Feed**: Should go to `/feed` automatically

4. **Verify Campaigns Load**:
   - Check if campaigns appear (from backend or mock data)
   - Check browser console (F12) - no errors
   - Check Network tab - GET request to `/campaigns/all`

5. **Test Application Submission**:
   - Click "Apply Now" on any campaign
   - Quick Apply modal opens
   - Fill in **Cover Letter** (required): 
     ```
     I am a great fit for this campaign because I have extensive experience...
     ```
   - Fill in **Portfolio Link** (optional):
     ```
     https://myportfolio.com
     ```
   - Fill in **Deliverables** (optional):
     ```
     5 Instagram posts, 10 stories, 2 reels
     ```
   - Click "Submit Application"

6. **Verify Success**:
   - ✅ Toast notification appears: "✓ Application submitted successfully!"
   - ✅ Application count increments on the campaign card
   - ✅ Check Network tab: POST to `/applications/campaigns/:id/apply` with 200 status
   - ✅ No console errors

---

## Step 5: Verify Backend Received Application

Check Terminal 1 (backend logs) for:
```
POST /applications/campaigns/:id/apply 201
```
