# Campaign Card Space Issue - FIXED ✅

## 🎯 Problem Identified
From the screenshot, the campaign card was **taking up too much vertical space** with:
- **Huge empty gray placeholder image** (192px tall)
- **Half the card was just empty space**
- **No actual campaign images needed**
- **Wasting valuable screen real estate**

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Removed Image Section Completely**
```tsx
// REMOVED THIS ENTIRE SECTION:
{campaign.image && (
  <div className="relative overflow-hidden">
    <img
      src={campaign.image}
      alt={campaign.title}
      className="w-full h-48 object-cover group-hover:scale-105 transition-transform duration-300"
    />
    <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-t from-black/20 to-transparent" />
  </div>
)}
```

### 2. **Removed Image Data from Mock Campaigns**
- Removed `image: '/api/placeholder/600/300'` from all campaign objects
- Image property remains **optional** in the interface (`image?: string`)
- If you add images later, they won't break anything

### 3. **Added Subtle Border to Actions Bar**
```tsx
// Added border-t for visual separation
<div className="p-4 bg-white/30 dark:bg-gray-900/30 backdrop-blur-sm border-t border-white/30">
```

## 📊 Impact

### Before (With Image):
```
Campaign Card Height Breakdown:
- Content Section: ~180px
- Empty Image: 192px ❌
- Actions Bar: 60px
─────────────────────

### After (No Image):
